# isBST
## This algorithm checks whether an input binary tree is BST. It uses Stream from Java 8.  

Example input:  
2  
2  
1 2 R 1 3 L  
4  
10 20 L 10 30 R 20 40 L 20 60 R  
  
The first line is the number of binary trees  
The second line is the number of edges in the first binary tree  
the third line is the information about the edges of the tree (e.g. 1 2 R, means 2 is the Right child of 1, etc)  
The second tree is in line 4 and 5.  
  
Output:  
false  
false
